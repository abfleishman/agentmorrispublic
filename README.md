I set this repo up for random utility scripts I want to share that don't fit in any of the other repos where I put random utility scripts.  If for some reason you want to know more about random utility scripts I write, the repos where most of them live are:

* <https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps>
* <https://github.com/microsoft/ai4eutils>
